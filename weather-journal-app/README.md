# Weather-Journal App

## Introduction
This web app created by an asynchronous web app uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.

## Project environment setup
Setup Node and Express on local machine, created the project file called server.js, made require express() and an instance using express,installed cors package and body-parser package from the command line as dependencies and created a local server.

## APIs and Routes
Created a JavaScript object named projectData initiated in the file server.js to act as the app API endpoint and created in server side a GET Route to get data and POST Route to store data in the endpoint.
After create API credentials on OpenWeatherMap.com i opend app.js file or clint side and saved my API key in variable and passed it as a parameter to fetch data from the external API.
